                To the left you'll see a picture of a 21 year old in front of a helicopter. That's me, Dakota, a few years ago. Prior to creating this website, I spent about six years in the Coast Guard. I decided to trade in my flight suit and black boots for blue jeans, a t-shirt, and tennis shoes. I traded in my flight helmet and flight gloves for a wide-brim straw hat and a backpack.

                Now I'm a student at University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh. I've had a few different ideas on what I would like the major in, but Information Systems (BBA) is what has stuck so far. I've been learning HTML and CSS the past few months with hopes to find a web development internship. After I learn a bit more of HTML and CSS, I plan on continuing my learning with JavaScript. Have a look at a few of my projects below!
